# rpmetaller-editor
A web-based tool to store, manage and publish information about concerts.
## requirements
The software does not have any special needs. A reasonably current version of PHP, the web server and MySQL or MariaDB should do the job. It is best to try it out :).
### Definitely working configuration
* PHP 7.4
* Apache 2.5
* MariaDB 10.4 or MySQL 8.0

or newer.
